# GRHP Analytics Engineering Project

## Context
The company, GRHP, receives 2 reports after the stock market closes. These 2 reports are
- A trade report generated by an internal order management application
- A trade report generated by an external trading system

## Objectives
Provide a solution and design/implement a report to enable users to
1. Recap total trading quantity and total transactions per product
  - Show difference in total trading quantity and the number of transactions per product between internal and external reports
2. Highlight product containing mismatches across internal and external reports
  - Identify which source report contains mismatched transactions

## Solution design
### Assumptions
1. Given that this scenario is likely a process that is carried out frequently, it should be assumed that the solution be automated by a set of tasks.
2. Mismatches are a cause for concern which could have significant implications if not remedied. It should be assumed that time-to-insights be minimal.

### Data transformation
The solution uses `dbt` as the data transformation tool to process raw data, the 2 reports in this case, and produce reliable and efficient reports.
Setup steps for the dbt project can be found in the `grhp/setup` directory.
Flow of data across the pipeline is shared in `grhp/README.md`.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Before proceeding to build the tables for the reconciliation report, it is non-trivial to carry out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the 2 trade reports.
Details of the EDA can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16LkjCB7Z9lyzEE-uAMaVWN-PZgQHEm1s)
