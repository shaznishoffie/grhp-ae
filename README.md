# GRHP Analytics Engineering Project

## Context
The company, GRHP, receives 2 reports after the stock market closes. These 2 reports are
- A trade report generated by an internal order management application
- A trade report generated by an external trading system

## Objectives
Provide a solution and design/implement a report to enable users to
1. Recap total trading quantity and total transactions per product
  - Show difference in total trading quantity and the number of transactions per product between internal and external reports
2. Highlight product containing mismatches across internal and external reports
  - Identify which source report contains mismatched transactions

## Solution design
### Assumptions
1. Given that this scenario is likely a process that is carried out frequently, it should be assumed that the solution be automated by a set of tasks.
2. Mismatches are a cause for concern which could have significant implications if not remedied. It should be assumed that time-to-insights be minimal.

### Data transformation
The solution uses `dbt` as the data transformation tool to process raw data, the 2 reports in this case, and produce reliable and efficient reports.
Setup steps for local development of the dbt project can be found in the [grhp/setup](https://github.com/shaznishoffie/grhp-ae/tree/main/setup) directory.
Flow of data across the pipeline is shared in [grhp/README.md](https://github.com/shaznishoffie/grhp-ae/blob/main/grhp/README.md) where the `dbt` project is located.
It is worth noting that in a fully-automated solution, the dbt project would be scheduled to run at appropriate intervals within the day where the schedule
is managed by a scheduler such as Apache Airflow.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Before proceeding to build the tables for the reconciliation report, it is non-trivial to carry out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the 2 trade reports.
Details of the EDA can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16LkjCB7Z9lyzEE-uAMaVWN-PZgQHEm1s)
